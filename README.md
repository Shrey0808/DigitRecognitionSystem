## 1. Introduction:
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in computer vision and serves as a foundational task for understanding deep learning concepts. This project employs a CNN to recognize and classify digits from the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## 2. Model Architecture:
The CNN architecture consists of two convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions and max-pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer for classification. The model is designed to extract hierarchical features from the input images, allowing it to learn discriminative representations for accurate digit classification.

## 3. Data Preprocessing:
The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed using PyTorch's torchvision module. Images are normalized and transformed into tensors, facilitating efficient model training.

## 4. Training Phase:
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. The training loop iterates through the MNIST training dataset, updating the model's weights to minimize the classification loss. Training progress is monitored through the display of loss values per epoch.

## 5. Testing Phase:
The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its generalization performance. The accuracy on the test set is calculated, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately classify unseen handwritten digits.

## 6. Results:
The trained CNN achieves a high accuracy of 98.99% on the MNIST test set, showcasing its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits.

## 7. Future Work:
Future enhancements may involve exploring more complex CNN architectures, incorporating data augmentation techniques, and applying transfer learning for improved performance on challenging datasets.
